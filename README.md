07-2D-Platformer

This is a project completed for C220 Game Technology at Indiana University. The purpose of the game was to create a 2D platformer game in Godot and written in GDScript. In this game, a bird is controlled using the arrow keys to move through clouds. The player must avoid enemy dragons shooting fire to get to the end of each of two levels. There are portals at the end of each level which transport the player either to the second level or the end screen. The game attempts to include a controlled player who can jump, more than one shooting enemy, a reported score, two levels, and a pause menu to stop and restart the game. 

Current problems include:
- enemy cannot shoot fire and problems connenting/routing the fire to the rest of the game
- the player scene is not being referenced properly in the fire script
- I don't know how to implement score into the game 
- The play button was working fine until portals were added and now it won't start 
- Believe there is something off with the SceneChangeButton
